# Solving P vs NP with Unverified Solutions

## Overview

This repository presents a formal and structural approach to the P vs NP problem. The central idea is to classify the **unverified solution sets** of NP problems and analyze their properties—especially their **density**—to distinguish between problems that belong to P and those that belong only to NP.

This work proposes that the structure and growth behavior of the space of unverified candidate solutions play a critical role in computational tractability.

## Key Concepts

- **Unverified Solution Set**: The set of candidate solutions that have not yet been verified as correct or incorrect by any polynomial-time algorithm.
- **Density Parameter (d)**: A measure of the ratio of valid solutions to the total number of candidate branches explored during computation.
- **Computation Tree**: A non-deterministic branching model that illustrates how a problem instance can be explored through successive verification steps.

## Main Contributions

1. **Classification of Unverified Sets**:
   - Finite sets
   - Uncountable sets
   - Countably infinite sets with measurable density `d`

2. **Structural Argument for P ≠ NP**:
   - If the set of unverified solutions grows with low density and requires exploration of exponentially many branches, then no polynomial-time algorithm can solve the problem.
   - This supports the position that there exist problems in NP that cannot be reduced to P.

3. **Illustrative Examples**:
   - The paper includes conceptual models of branching computation trees and how they evolve based on the density of the unverified space.
